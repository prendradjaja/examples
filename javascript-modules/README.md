## JavaScript modules

Minimal example of using modules in JavaScript. Works in browser and at the
command line (i.e. via `node`). Tested on Chrome 92 and Node 12.


### Running in browser

Due to CORS, when running locally, a server is required.


### Running at the command line

A package.json with `"type": "module"` is required. (included in this example)
